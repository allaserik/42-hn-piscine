# Background on Prime Numbers:

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers other than 1 and itself. Prime numbers play a fundamental role in number theory and have applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science.

Prime numbers have been studied for centuries, with ancient mathematicians like Euclid making significant contributions. Prime numbers are essential in modern cryptography, where large prime numbers are used in algorithms like RSA for secure communication.

Prime searching algorithms and functions aim to efficiently identify prime numbers within a given range or determine whether a specific number is prime. There are various algorithms for prime generation and primality testing, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes and probabilistic algorithms like Miller-Rabin.

In the provided functions, a basic approach is used to check primality, iterating through potential divisors up to half of the number being tested. While this approach works, more efficient algorithms exist for practical purposes, especially when dealing with large numbers.
