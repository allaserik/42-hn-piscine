Here's a step-by-step guide for a simple Git workflow for a small team working with branches and merging. This workflow assumes the use of a main branch (e.g., main or master) and feature branches:

# Git clone the project repository

git clone <url> <dirname>

# Create and switch to a new feature branch

git checkout -b feature-branch

git pull origin feature-branch
git pull origin master
git merge master

# Make and stage your changes

git add .
or
git add *

# Commit your changes

git commit -m "Implement feature XYZ"

# Push the feature branch to the remote repository

git push origin feature-branch

# Make the feature branch up to date with master

git fetch origin
git checkout feature-branch
git merge origin/master

# Merge the Feature Branch into Main

# Switch to the main branch

git checkout master

# Ensure your main branch is up-to-date

git pull origin master

# Merge the feature branch into main

git merge feature-branch

# Resolve Conflicts (if any)

If conflicts occur during the merge, resolve them using git mergetool or manually.
Commit the resolved changes.

# Push the changes to the remote main branch

git push origin master

# Delete the local feature branch

git branch -d feature-branch

# Delete the remote feature branch

# Note: This step assumes your remote repository supports branch deletion

git push origin --delete feature-branch

For each new feature, repeat the process starting from creating a feature branch.

Code review can be done locally or through other means like pair programming or team discussions. Make sure to communicate effectively with your team and maintain clear documentation of changes.
